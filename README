## INFO

Mobile data visualization Web-App for temporal and geographic datasets, initially build for the VPRO during app-in-a-day on 16 Feb 2011.

## KNOWN BUGS

* Slider not really working at the moment, as in no data is coming back from the server
* Somehow the ui-slider captures all the touch events so scaling of the freaking nice khtml calendar won't work anymore...

Uhm.. plenty more probably, this is just an initial commit
